## How These Skills Work

Each skill is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter tells the
agent when the skill is relevant; the body provides the workflow to follow once
the skill is triggered.

Skills should describe public behavior and user-visible workflow. They must not
publish private service names, credentials, internal paths, private URLs, or
implementation details that are not intended for external use.
